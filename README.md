# Sorting
## Aim 
To sort inputed data by selection sort, insertion sort and bubble sort.
## Description
Sorting is the process of arranging the data in ascending order. In this program, sorting has been done by 3 methods, namely bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort.

BUBBLE SORT: The array of elements is sorted by comparing all the elements in pairs and swapping their position wherever required.

SELECTTION SORT: In this method, the element at the first position is assumed to be the minimum value and is compared with every element of the array and swapping of elements is done wherever required. After one iteration, the first element of the sorted data is fixed and then the second element is compared with each of the elements excluding the first. This continues untill the entire data is sorted.

INSERTION SORT: Insertion sort is based on the idea that one element from the input elements is consumed in each iteration to find its correct position i.e, the position to which it belongs in a sorted array.It iterates the input elements by growing the sorted array at each iteration. It compares the current element with the largest value in the sorted array. If the current element is greater, then it leaves the element in its place and moves on to the next element else it finds its correct position in the sorted array and moves it to that position. This is done by shifting all the elements, which are larger than the current element, in the sorted array to one position ahead
